	<p class="class2"> Duelist </p><br>

	<p class="class4"> Phoenix is an offensive VALORANT agent, who specializes in hunting down enemies, while crippling their ability to fire back.<br> 
						The Blaze ability creates walls that blocks vision and deals damage, allowing Phoenix to sneak past defended open areas,<br>  
						while Curveball blinds enemies, even if they're hinding behind corners.<br>  
						In combination, Hot Hands and the Run it Back ultimate make Phoenix a very durable duelist and players who like to<br>  
						play aggressively will really enjoy this agent's gameplay<br> <br>
